<h2>Prospective B.S. Student</h2>
<p>Our group opens our lab to undergraduate students to be member as graduate student. During summer and winter season, we have open camp for designing VLSI circuit systems and C programming implementation. Students interested in our lab don't hesitate to contact us. If you send us via email, please attach your resume or CV letter, especially declare your objectives to achieve during graduate school.</p>
<h2>Prospective M.S. Student</h2>
<p>Graduate school is not everything to get M.S. degree. M.S. degree don't guarantee the job position in industry. If you consider M.S. degree to get your job, we do not recommend to enter the graduate school. Your effort on our lab is helpful to start your career in research institute or technology-oriented company. If it's possible, we recommend M.S.-Ph.D. integrated course, then go into the world as professor in university or research fellow in research institute.</p>
<h2>Prospective Ph.D. Student</h2>
<p>We recommend to obtain Ph.D. degree for prospective candidates, who are interested in the research of VLSI circuit and system design, because these topics require long time to understand and study. Prior experience in electronic design including integrated circuit design and good English skills are required. You can find the type of research projects we are currently engaged in on our research page. You may also want to check out our publication list to get to know more about our research topics.</p>
<p>If you are self-driven, highly motivated candidates and like our research topics, you should contact us with the CV letter before you apply through the official site. We will carefully review your applications. If you have specific questions, please email Prof. Park. But, please note that not all emails of qualified applicants can be answered due to the large volume of emails.</p>
